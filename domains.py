==========

The domain registry. Adding a third domain means adding one entry here and
dropping its four artefact files into `data/`. No other file changes.

Each domain's artefacts are produced by the Colab notebook (Modules 9 and 9b)
from a single extraction implementation, Module 3b, which reads conditions and
effects off the Unified Planning model rather than matching on action names.
That is why the same four files describe both domains.
