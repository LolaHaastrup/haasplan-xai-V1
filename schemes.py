==========

Plain-language descriptions of the nine argument schemes, and a builder for
the argumentation framework diagram.

The descriptions are presentation only. Nothing in the framework is derived
from this file; it exists so a participant who has never met argumentation
theory can read the Framework tab without a glossary beside them.
