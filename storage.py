==========

Where participant responses go, and in what shape.

THE SHEET IS THE ANALYSIS FILE
------------------------------
One row per participant, one column per questionnaire item, Likert responses
coded 1 to 5. Download the sheet as CSV and it loads straight into R, SPSS,
Stata or pandas with no unpacking step. That is why the questionnaire is not
stored as a JSON blob: a blob is fine for archiving and useless for analysis.

Section F applies only to participants who saw a rejected plan. Their cells are
left EMPTY rather than zero, so a mean over F1 ignores them correctly instead
of dragging the average down.

EVERY SAVE IS WRITTEN TWICE
---------------------------
Once to the sheet, once to a local JSON Lines file. The local copy exists
because Streamlit Community Cloud has an ephemeral filesystem and the sheet is
the durable record, but if the Sheets call fails mid-study the response is
still on disk for the remainder of that container's life, which gives you a
chance to recover it. save() reports success only if at least one destination
took the row, and reports which.

API CALLS
---------
The gspread calls used here were verified against gspread 6.1.4:
service_account_from_dict, open_by_key, sheet1, acell, append_row,
get_all_values, get_all_records. The header row is written once, detected by
reading cell A1 rather than pulling the whole sheet, because pulling the whole
sheet on every save gets slow and burns quota as the study grows.
